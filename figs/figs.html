In spite of his position, Alad V showed a particular contempt towards the Grineer and to a lesser extent, the Tenno. He eventually became obsessed with the promise of biological research on the Infested, with the hopes of creating very powerful bio-weaponry, going as far as using Technocyte on his own armor and sacrificing prototypes from his Zanuka Project.</p>

						<p class= "pea"> Vay Hek's fanatical loyalty to the Grineer cause has driven him to spearhead a numerous majority of Grineer operations against the Tenno and their allies. As outspoken as he is zealous, he is also known for hijacking Tenno transmissions to send boastful messages, with targets ranging from Relay broadcasts to even a Devstream outside of the WARFRAME universe. Coupled with his position in the Grineer hierarchy and (later on) access to the formidable Fomorian fleet, he is one of the most dangerous enemies the Tenno have encountered.</p>
