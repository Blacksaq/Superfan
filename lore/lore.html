					<p>Continuity is a ritual first mentioned in The War Within, and is suggested to be the ritual the Orokin used for their supposed immortality.

Continuity, in its very essence, is the (destructive) transfer of a consciousness from one body to another, with the mind-altering properties of Kuva playing a key role in it.

The ritual consisted of Orokin whose current bodies have grown old and frail, going to a Yuvan Theatre, where selected young and beautiful potential hosts would be paraded for display and selection. The Orokin would then choose the person (Yuvan) whose body they would use as their new body, after which the Orokin would invade said person's mind under the influence of the liquid Kuva until only the Orokin's mind remained inside the body, erasing the former host's consciousness.</p>

					<p>The Tenno are descendants of an ancient and mystical civilization of lost warriors from the Orokin era on Earth. Preserved in cryopods for centuries, the Tenno now awaken to a new war, fighting and resisting warring factions as the sole bearers of the Orokin-created Warframes. While the memories of the Tenno have faded over time, their mastery of guns, blades, and Warframe exo-armor has not.</p>
